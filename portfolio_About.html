                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>Born in Savannah, raised in Atlanta, I am a GA boy at heart. I love making music and spending time in the recording studio, and I love to travel. Recently I have picked up a love for cooking! After High School, I joined the Air Force with a life plan of commissioning, becoming an Officer and staying in for about 25-30 years. Unfortunately, a seizure while I was deployed cut that dream short. I was devastated and afraid because I didn't have another plan. I didn't have a backup life plan. To break the tension and help me, one of my Sargeants told me I was a "freakin Nerd" and suggested I go into computers.</p>
                <p>That was the beginning of my new life.</p>
                <p>I started contracting as a help desk rep for the AFNet Helpdesk and eventually worked my way up to System Administration before Covid hit. After Covid, I could not seem to find any progressive work. I started to see my advancement opportunities fade. I decided to be proactive and find a new trade, where I could progress and improve my quality-of-life. Coding Temple has been essential in revitalizing my curiosity for new technologies and new theories. I feel like I have a new lease on life!</p>
                <p>I hope that this career will afford me the opportunity to create a better qualtiy of life for myself and my family.</p>
